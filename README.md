# Python 101
## Basic Projects

Learning basic python with my buds.

Contents:
 - Project_1: Write a basic python app that will say "Hello World" (and maybe something more...)
 - Project_2: _G-33 Challenge_: allow user to input letter and number and perform correct truncation/rounding based on letter
 - MA_I_Data: _Reading MA--I Files_: large project to ultimately look for MA-I filings on SEC's EDGAR site and download them for further analysis
